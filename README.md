# Pinpoint Node.js Agent
This is the official Node.js agent for [Pinpoint](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint).

If you have any feedback or questions,
please post them on the [Discuss issues](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint-node-agent/issues).


## Installation and getting started
### 1. Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```sh
npm install --save pinpoint-node-agent 
```
Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```sh
yarn add pinpoint-node-agent
```

### 2. Adding a code

To run Pinpoint agent for your own applications, make sure you have the prerequisites in place first.

ES6
```ecmascript 6
  import 'pinpoint-node-agent'  
```

CommonJS
```javascript
  require('pinpoint-node-agent')
```
#### Webpack with `node -r` (required: above v0.8.2)
In Node with Webpack, if the Pinpoint Node agent cannot hook the HTTP module, it is the case that http.createServer is called first in the JS code compiled by webpack. 

The'pinpoint-node-agent' require or import in the source code should be deleted.
```
$ node -r pinpoint-node-agent dist/entry.js
```

If you are using pm2, use node-args(CLI) or node_args(Ecosystem File).
```
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    'node_args': ['-r', 'pinpoint-node-agent']
  }]
}
```

### 3. Configuration with Environment variables
Based on the [pinpoint-config-default.json](/lib/pinpoint-config-default.json) file, only necessary parts are set as environment variables.

name | default | description
-----|---------|------------
PINPOINT_AGENT_ID |  | The maximum length is 24. a required variable.
PINPOINT_APPLICATION_NAME | | meaningful name of the app. an application name can have multiple PINPOINT_AGENT_ID. The maximum length is 24. a required variable. 
PINPOINT_COLLECTOR_IP | localhost | The address that the Pinpoint collector. ex) 192.168.0.1
PINPOINT_SAMPLING_RATE | 10 | Sample rate of incoming HTTP or HTTPS request. The value is calculated as 1/value.
PINPOINT_LOG_LEVEL | WARN | Log level
PINPOINT_ENABLE | true | If you set it to false, the agent will not work.
PINPOINT_CONTAINER | false | Whether to use docker or kubernetes. If the PINPOINT_CONTAINER environment variable is not set, the agent analyzes the'/.dockerenv' and'/proc/self/cgroup' files to determine whether to use the Docker container. If the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST environment variable exists, it is determined that it is the kubernetes environment and changes it to the true value.
PINPOINT_TRACE_EXCLUSION_URL_PATTERN |  | comma-separated string. ex) `/health_check,/admin/**` or [Unit tests](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-node-agent/blob/01fcbdefe5a0ffba9c957bee0da3fb7397638182/test/utils/ant-path-matcher.test.js#L332)
PINPOINT_TRACE_EXCLUSION_URL_CACHE_SIZE | | If the app is designed so that the pathname of the URL is fixed, if the cache size is set, the pathname of the frequently used URL does not match with patterns. In case of using query for pathname like `/user/1000`, cache is unnecessarily. [Unit tests](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-node-agent/blob/01fcbdefe5a0ffba9c957bee0da3fb7397638182/test/utils/ant-path-matcher.test.js#L447)

### Agent ID
The agent ID is used as the identifier per the server or node. You need to set the hostname or node identifier(The maximum length is 24) on the server.
```
PINPOINT_AGENT_ID=${HOSTNAME} pm2 start ~/service/bin/pm2_start.jsonâ€‹
```

# Pinpoint Node.js Agent
This is the official Node.js agent for [Pinpoint](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint).

If you have any feedback or questions,
please post them on the [Discuss issues](https://github.com/naver/pinpoint-node-agent/issues).


## Installation and getting started
### 1. Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```sh
npm install --save pinpoint-node-agent
```
Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```sh
yarn add pinpoint-node-agent
```

### 2. Adding a code

To run Pinpoint agent for your own applications, make sure you have the prerequisites in place first.

ES6
```ecmascript 6
  import 'pinpoint-node-agent'
```

CommonJS
```javascript
  require('pinpoint-node-agent')
```
#### Webpack with `node -r` (required: above v0.8.2)
In Node with Webpack, if the Pinpoint Node agent cannot hook the HTTP module, it is the case that http.createServer is called first in the JS code compiled by webpack.

The'pinpoint-node-agent' require or import in the source code should be deleted.
```
$ node -r pinpoint-node-agent dist/entry.js
```

If you are using pm2, use node-args(CLI) or node_args(Ecosystem File).
```
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./app.js",
    'node_args': ['-r', 'pinpoint-node-agent']
  }]
}
```

### 3. Configuration with Environment variables
Based on the [pinpoint-config-default.json](/lib/pinpoint-config-default.json) file, only necessary parts are set as environment variables.

The PINPOINT_AGENT_ID, PINPOINT_AGENT_NAME and PINPOINT_APPLICATION_NAME pattern are `[a-zA-Z0-9\\._\\-]+`.


### ⚠️ v0.8.7 Breaking Changes
- **AgentId no longer required**: The `AgentId` field is now optional. If an `AgentId` is not provided, it will be automatically generated. This change may affect systems or scripts that previously relied on manually setting the `AgentId`.
- **Agent Name Added**: The `Agent Name` field is now a new optional configuration and can be set as a user-defined value with a maximum length of 255 characters. Developers can optionally use the pod name or any other identifier as the Agent Name. Ensure that your configuration aligns with this new behavior.

name | default | description
-----|---------|------------
PINPOINT_AGENT_ID |  | The maximum length is 24. If you don't set an Agent ID, it will be set to a random hex value.
PINPOINT_AGENT_NAME |  | The maximum length is 255. Agent Name is optional value. Agent names should be set up so that they make sense to humans. After you set the Agent Name, it appears in the Inspector.
PINPOINT_APPLICATION_NAME | | meaningful name of the app. an application name can have multiple PINPOINT_AGENT_ID. The maximum length is 24. a required variable.
PINPOINT_COLLECTOR_IP | localhost | The address that the Pinpoint collector. ex) 192.168.0.1
PINPOINT_SAMPLING_RATE | 10 | Sample rate of incoming HTTP or HTTPS request. The value is calculated as 1/value.
PINPOINT_LOG_LEVEL | WARN | Log level
PINPOINT_ENABLE | true | If you set it to false, the agent will not work.
PINPOINT_CONTAINER | false | Whether to use docker or kubernetes. If the PINPOINT_CONTAINER environment variable is not set, the agent analyzes the'/.dockerenv' and'/proc/self/cgroup' files to determine whether to use the Docker container. If the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST environment variable exists, it is determined that it is the kubernetes environment and changes it to the true value.
PINPOINT_TRACE_EXCLUSION_URL_PATTERN |  | comma-separated string. ex) `/health_check,/admin/**` or [Unit tests](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-node-agent/blob/01fcbdefe5a0ffba9c957bee0da3fb7397638182/test/utils/ant-path-matcher.test.js#L332)
PINPOINT_TRACE_EXCLUSION_URL_CACHE_SIZE | | If the app is designed so that the pathname of the URL is fixed, if the cache size is set, the pathname of the frequently used URL does not match with patterns. In case of using query for pathname like `/user/1000`, cache is unnecessarily. [Unit tests](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-node-agent/blob/01fcbdefe5a0ffba9c957bee0da3fb7397638182/test/utils/ant-path-matcher.test.js#L447)
PINPOINT_LOG_ERROR | false | The `PINPOINT_LOG_ERROR` environment variable controls whether error logs generated by Pinpoint are displayed in the console. By default, these logs are not shown. To enable error log output, set this variable to `true`.

## Sampling rate
If you use [Performance tester for sampling rate](/demo/performance-tester), you can review while changing the sampling rate of the node agent of the Node application.

## No support the JVM agent features
The Pinpoint Node agent does not support the following the JVM agent features. We plan to provide more detailed app information like the JVM agent.
* Active Request
* Some inspector information(Transactions Per Second, Active Request ...)
